"""
Our company, "Jaws Adventures", offers scuba diving for people.
We would like to analyse and market a new product: shark feeding.
However people may express distress to the idea of feeding sharks and the risks involved.
Let's analyse whether feeding sharks is safer than other activities already offered by our company.
"""

"""
For this, we will need to pull the data from columns:
- Activity (categorical)
- Fatal (Y/N) (categorical, binary: Y/N)

However, we know that the database is kind of messy, so we will need to do some data wrangling (cleaning) before.
